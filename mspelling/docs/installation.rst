Installation
============

The current method of installion requires downloading mSpelling and allowing your computer to 
open it (MacOS).

To install mspelling:

1. Download the most recent version of mspelling from the 
   `release page <https://github.com/mario-bermonti/mspelling/releases>`_ 
2. Open the app by double clicking on it

You will probably receive a message that the app cannot be verified and that you should not open
it. That is OK, is just Apple being very cautious. 

To enable the app:

1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Security
2. Press Open Anyway
3. That is it! You can now open the app again.
