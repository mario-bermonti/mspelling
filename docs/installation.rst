The current method of installion requires installing mSpelling and its dependencies manually (sorry, this will be simplified soon).

To install mspelling:

1.  Install poetry (`poetry's documentation`_)
2.  Download `mspelling`_ or clone it into your computer using git
3.  Open a terminal and change your working directory into mSpelling's directory (check this `cheatsheet`_ for more info)
4.  To install mspelling and all its dependencies run:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ poetry install

.. _poetry's documentation: https://python-poetry.org/
.. _mspelling: https://github.com/mario-bermonti/mspelling/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.1.zip
.. _cheatsheet: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/
..

..
   To install mspelling, run this command in your terminal:

   .. code-block:: console

       $ pip install mspelling

   This is the preferred method to install mspelling, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

   If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
   you through the process.
