Files at stable/ and daily/ are directly used to make builds at launchpad.
Therefore builds at daily PPA as well as at the stable PPA might break on changes.
To see the current build status, take a look at:
- https://code.launchpad.net/~kivy-team/+archive/ubuntu/kivy/+packages       (PPA for stable builds)
- https://code.launchpad.net/~kivy-team/+recipe/kivy-stable                  (recipe for stable builds)
- https://code.launchpad.net/~kivy-team/+archive/ubuntu/kivy-daily/+packages (PPA for daily builds)
- https://code.launchpad.net/~kivy-team/+recipe/kivy-daily                   (recipe for daily builds)
