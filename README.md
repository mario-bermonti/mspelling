## Description

![demo](./mspelling_gif.gif)

Words are presented by the computer one at a time and the participant types the word
using the keyboard. Participants have a rest period after every 5 trials.

At the end of the session, mspelling saves the results to a CSV file, which is supported
by most popular spreadsheet software these days (e.g., Excel).

mSpelling is developed using the Python programming language v3.
