![demo](../mspelling_gif.gif)

Words are presented by the computer one at a time and the participant types the word
using the keyboard. Participants have a rest period after every 5 trials.

mSpelling saves the results to a sqlite database at the end of the session.

mSpelling is developed using the [Google's Flutter Framework](https://flutter.dev/) and has been 
used in the DeMo and TEST studies [(more info)](https://mario-bermonti.github.io/research/).
